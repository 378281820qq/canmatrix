Python Can Matrix Object describing the Can-Communication (Boardunits, Frames, Signals, Values, ...)

This Python-Object can be used for importing and exporting Can-Matrices in several Formats.
Further this Project includes some stubs for generating Code out of a Can-Matrix. 

DISCLAIMER:
This is 'couchware', this software is created on the couch while watching TV.
Thus, the quality is very bad!
DON'T USE IT FOR ANY SERIOUS WORK ON CARS!

Currently partly working:
* generate Javascript out of .dbc
* generate Busmaster Simulation out of .dbc
The rest is NOT even tested...

Have Fun
