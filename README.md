Python Can Matrix Object describing the Can-Communication (Boardunits, Frames, Signals, Values, ...)

This Python-Object can be used for importing and exporting Can-Matrices in several Formats.
Further this Project includes some stubs for generating Code out of a Can-Matrix. 

DISCLAIMER:
This is 'couchware', this software is coded on the couch while watching TV.
Thus, the quality is very bad!
DON'T USE IT FOR ANY SERIOUS WORK ON CARS!

Currently partly working:
* convert .dbc -> .kcd
* convert .dbc -> .dbf
* convert .arxml -> .dbc
* generate Busmaster Simulation out of .dbc
* generate Busmaster Simulation out of .dbf


The rest is NOT even tested...

Formatspecific:
* generate Busmaster Simulation out of .kcd will never work, because default-framedata missing


For a Windows you need python and lxml library for python. 
I use active python 

 

Have Fun
